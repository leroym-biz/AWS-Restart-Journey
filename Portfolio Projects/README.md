## About This Portfolio

This folder contains **real-world AWS projects** that go beyond basic tutorials. Each project solves an actual business problem, implements production-ready architecture, and demonstrates the kind of cloud engineering work you'd do on the job.

I'm not just spinning up resources and calling it a day. I'm designing solutions, documenting decisions, and building infrastructure that scales. These projects prove I can:
- Architect multi-tier AWS solutions
- Implement security best practices from day one
- Automate deployments and configurations
- Present technical solutions to non-technical stakeholders
- Document everything for future reference

**The Goal:** Build a portfolio that shows I can actually build things, not just pass certification exams.

## Featured Projects

### Project 01: Embers & Co - Static Website Hosting

  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-success?style=flat-square">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-S3%20%7C%20CloudFront%20%7C%20Route53-orange?style=flat-square">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Focus-Serverless%20Web%20Hosting-blue?style=flat-square">

**The Problem:** A Melville restaurant with 100+ daily customers suffering from manual booking chaos—double-bookings, lost reservations, frustrated staff, and revenue loss.

**The Solution:** Built a fully functional static website with:
- **S3 + CloudFront** architecture for lightning-fast global delivery
- **Production security** with CloudFront-only S3 access policies
- **Professional presentation** with business case and ROI analysis
- **7-week migration roadmap** costing less than two meals

**Business Impact:**
- 99.999999999% data durability vs. manual paper records
- Sub-100ms global load times via CloudFront edge locations
- $14/month vs. thousands in lost revenue from booking errors
- 60% cost reduction compared to traditional hosting

**Tech Stack:** Amazon S3, CloudFront, Route 53, IAM, HTML/CSS/JS

**Key Takeaway:** This project proved I can translate technical architecture into business value. The restaurant owner doesn't care about IAM policies—they care about eliminating double-bookings and recovering lost revenue.

### Project 02: [Coming Soon]

**Status:** In Development

More production-grade projects coming soon. Each one will demonstrate different AWS services and real-world architecture patterns.

---

### Project 03: [Coming Soon]

**Status:** Planned

Building a portfolio that showcases the full range of AWS capabilities—compute, storage, databases, networking, security, and serverless.

## Project Structure

Each project follows a consistent structure for easy navigation:

```
Portfolio_Projects/
├── project_01_Highly_Available_Static_Website/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── screenshots/          # Visual documentation
│   ├── EMBERS-CO-presentation.pdf # Business case presentation
│   └── readme.md                  # Full project documentation
├── project_02/                    # Next project
├── project_03/                    # Future project
└── README.md                      # This file
```

**Why This Structure Matters:**
- **Consistency** — Every project documented the same way
- **Professionalism** — Easy for hiring managers to navigate
- **Completeness** — Code, screenshots, presentations, and explanations
- **Real-world proof** — Not just code dumps, but full project lifecycle

## Skills Demonstrated

### 🛠️ Cloud Architecture

**What I'm Building:**
- Multi-tier AWS architectures with proper separation of concerns
- Serverless solutions that scale automatically
- High-availability patterns across multiple availability zones
- Cost-optimized infrastructure using the right service for each use case

**Projects Showcasing This:**
- Embers & Co: S3 + CloudFront serverless architecture
- Coming projects: EC2, RDS, Lambda, DynamoDB implementations

---

### 🛠️ Security Engineering

**What I'm Implementing:**
- Zero-trust security models (S3 buckets locked to CloudFront only)
- IAM policies following principle of least privilege
- Encryption at rest and in transit (KMS, TLS/SSL)
- Security Groups and NACLs for network isolation

**Projects Showcasing This:**
- Embers & Co: CloudFront Service Principal with SourceArn conditions
- Coming projects: VPC isolation, KMS encryption, WAF integration

---

### 🛠️ Business Communication

**What I'm Delivering:**
- Technical solutions presented in business language
- ROI analysis and cost-benefit breakdowns
- Migration roadmaps with realistic timelines
- PowerPoint presentations for stakeholder buy-in

**Projects Showcasing This:**
- Embers & Co: Complete business case presentation
- Coming projects: Architecture decision records (ADRs)

---

### 🛠️ DevOps & Automation

**What I'm Automating:**
- Infrastructure as Code thinking (even for manual deployments)
- Repeatable deployment patterns
- Configuration management
- CI/CD pipeline architecture

**Projects Showcasing This:**
- Embers & Co: Documentation-first approach for future automation
- Coming projects: CloudFormation, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines

---

## What Makes These Projects Different

### 1. Real Business Problems

I'm not building "Deploy a static website to S3" tutorials. I'm solving actual business problems:
- Restaurant losing revenue from double-bookings
- Companies needing secure, scalable infrastructure
- Organizations migrating from on-premises to cloud

### 2. Production-Ready Architecture

Every project follows AWS best practices:
- Security by design, not as an afterthought
- High availability and disaster recovery planning
- Cost optimization from day one
- Proper IAM permissions and encryption

### 3. Complete Documentation

Each project includes:
- Business problem definition
- Architecture diagrams and explanations
- Implementation steps with screenshots
- Security considerations
- What I learned and why it matters

### 4. Stakeholder Presentations

Technical skills alone don't land jobs. I'm proving I can:
- Present solutions to non-technical stakeholders
- Translate AWS services into business value
- Create professional presentations and proposals
- Document decisions for future teams

## The Bigger Picture

This portfolio is part of my **AWS Restart Journey**—a three-month focused program documenting my path to AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and beyond.

But I'm not just chasing a cert. I'm building **proof of work**:
- Hands-on projects demonstrating real cloud skills
- Architecture decisions explained in detail
- Business communication and presentation skills
- A portfolio that stands out from tutorial-following competitors

**The Questions These Projects Answer:**

For hiring managers:
- Can you architect AWS solutions? ✅ Yes, here's the S3 + CloudFront architecture
- Can you implement security? ✅ Yes, here's the CloudFront-only access policy
- Can you present to stakeholders? ✅ Yes, here's the PowerPoint deck
- Can you document your work? ✅ Yes, here's the complete README

For me:
- Do I understand AWS services deeply? ✅ Yes, I can explain trade-offs
- Can I solve real business problems? ✅ Yes, here's the ROI analysis
- Am I ready for cloud engineering roles? ✅ Yes, here's the proof
