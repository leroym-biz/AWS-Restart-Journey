## About This Portfolio

This folder contains **real-world AWS projects** that go beyond basic tutorials. Each project solves an actual business problem, implements production-ready architecture, and demonstrates the kind of cloud engineering work you'd do on the job.

I'm not just spinning up resources and calling it a day. I'm designing solutions, documenting decisions, and building infrastructure that scales. These projects prove I can:
- Architect multi-tier AWS solutions
- Implement security best practices from day one
- Automate deployments and configurations
- Present technical solutions to non-technical stakeholders
- Document everything for future reference

**The Goal:** Build a portfolio that shows I can actually build things, not just pass certification exams.

## Featured Projects

### Project 01: Ember & Co - Static Website Hosting

  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-success?style=flat-square">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-S3%20%7C%20CloudFront%20%7C%20Route53-orange?style=flat-square">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Focus-Serverless%20Web%20Hosting-blue?style=flat-square">

**The Problem:** A Melville restaurant with 100+ daily customers suffering from manual booking chaos—double-bookings, lost reservations, frustrated staff, and revenue loss.

**The Solution:** Built a fully functional static website with:
- **S3 + CloudFront** architecture for lightning-fast global delivery
- **Production security** with CloudFront-only S3 access policies
- **Professional presentation** with business case and ROI analysis
- **7-week migration roadmap** costing less than two meals

**Business Impact:**
- 99.999999999% data durability vs. manual paper records
- Sub-100ms global load times via CloudFront edge locations
- $14/month vs. thousands in lost revenue from booking errors
- 60% cost reduction compared to traditional hosting

**Tech Stack:** Amazon S3, CloudFront, Route 53, IAM, HTML/CSS/JS

**Key Takeaway:** This project proved I can translate technical architecture into business value. The restaurant owner doesn't care about IAM policies—they care about eliminating double-bookings and recovering lost revenue.

### Project 02: Pet Shore - 3D E-Commerce Platform Architecture

  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-success?style=flat-square">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-S3%20%7C%20CloudFront%20%7C%20EC2%20%7C%20RDS%20%7C%20DynamoDB-orange?style=flat-square">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Focus-Multi--Tier%20Architecture-blue?style=flat-square">

**The Problem:** Designing cloud infrastructure for a 3D shopping platform where fast content delivery and surviving traffic spikes isn't optional—it's survival.

**The Solution:** Architected a production-grade 3-tier AWS application:
- **Content Delivery (CloudFront + S3)** for global 3D model caching at edge locations
- **Elastic Compute (EC2 + Auto Scaling + ALB)** that responds to demand automatically
- **Dual-Database Strategy (RDS + DynamoDB)** balancing consistency and speed
- **Multi-AZ architecture** engineered for failure scenarios

**Technical Impact:**
- 95% reduction in origin server load through edge caching
- 28 seconds to 3 seconds average load time for 50MB 3D models
- Auto Scaling eliminates 3 AM idle capacity costs
- Multi-AZ deployment survives entire data center failures

**Tech Stack:** Amazon S3, CloudFront, EC2, Auto Scaling, Application Load Balancer, RDS, DynamoDB, Route 53, VPC

**Key Takeaway:** Fast content delivery is non-negotiable for 3D applications. This project taught me how to design systems that handle unpredictable traffic, engineer for expected failures, and balance complexity vs. performance vs. cost.

### Project 03: Cloud Learners Inc - IAM Security Training Chatbot

  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-success?style=flat-square">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-Lex%20%7C%20Lambda%20%7C%20CloudWatch-orange?style=flat-square">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Focus-Conversational%20AI-blue?style=flat-square">

**The Problem:** Students consistently confuse IAM Users vs Roles, Authentication vs Authorization, and over-permission with Administrator Access. Traditional lectures result in passive learning with low retention—and 40% of cloud security breaches stem from IAM misconfigurations.

**The Solution:** Built an intelligent conversational AI that teaches AWS IAM through scenario-based questioning:
- **Serverless architecture (Lex + Lambda)** where Lex is the "mouth" and Lambda is the "brain"
- **Branching logic** that teaches from wrong answers, not just validates correct ones
- **Natural language input handling** supporting conversational responses like "I think B"
- **Production-grade code** with input normalization, error handling, and CloudWatch logging

**Technical Impact:**
- 3 scenario-based questions addressing real IAM confusion points
- 4 distinct conversation paths based on answer correctness
- Under $3 for 1,000 quiz completions with automatic scaling
- Educational feedback explaining production consequences of wrong answers

**Tech Stack:** AWS Lex V2, Lambda (Node.js), CloudWatch, IAM

**Key Takeaway:** This project proved I can build conversational AI that creates real learning moments. We didn't ask "What is IAM?"—we asked "Your EC2 needs S3 access. IAM User or Role?" Context creates memory. Branching logic transforms information retrieval into education.

**Real Challenges Solved:**
- Lambda permission denied (learned resource-based policies the hard way)
- Invalid input handling (Lex slot configuration vs Lambda validation)
- Natural language processing (regex pattern matching for conversational input)
- Response formatting (visual separators for chat interface readability)

## What Makes These Projects Different

### 1. Real Business Problems

I'm not building "Deploy a static website to S3" tutorials. I'm solving actual business problems:
- Restaurant losing revenue from double-bookings
- E-commerce platform needing to handle 50MB 3D models without losing customers
- Educational startup needing to clarify IAM confusion points causing 40% of breaches

### 2. Production-Ready Architecture

Every project follows AWS best practices:
- Security by design, not as an afterthought
- High availability and disaster recovery planning
- Cost optimization from day one
- Proper IAM permissions and encryption

### 3. Complete Documentation

Each project includes:
- Business problem definition
- Architecture diagrams and explanations
- Implementation steps with screenshots
- Security considerations and trade-off analysis
- What I learned and why it matters

### 4. Stakeholder Presentations

Technical skills alone don't land jobs. I'm proving I can:
- Present solutions to non-technical stakeholders
- Translate AWS services into business value
- Create professional presentations and proposals
- Document decisions for future teams
