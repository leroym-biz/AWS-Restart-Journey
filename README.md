<h1 align="center">🚀 AWS Portfolio: Cloud Practitioner Certification & Advanced Projects (3-Month Log) ☁️</h1>

---

## ⭐ What I'm Really Doing Here: Moving Past Memorization

Hey, thanks for stopping by.  
This repository is my focused, three-month portfolio.  

Honestly, the goal isn't just to pass the CCP exam; it's to prove I can actually build things in AWS.  
I'm spending all my time documenting my hands-on ability across the Console, CLI, and, most importantly, Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

My documentation follows the full curriculum, but the real emphasis is on the stuff teams actually hire for:  
**Automation, Security best practices, and knowing how to architect for Scalability.**

## 💡 Projects I Built (Portfolio_Projects)

This is the good stuff—where the theory had to turn into working code.  
These aren't simple "Hello World" labs; they're multi-service challenges designed to replicate real-world architectural headaches.  
Reviewing these shows you how I think about design.

| 🧩 **Project Title** | ⚙️ **Core Services** | 🎯 **Key Architectural Skill I Learned** |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Highly Available Static Website** | S3, CloudFront, Route 53 | Figuring out how to use a Global Content Delivery Network (CDN) to keep latency low and hosting costs sensible. |
| **Server Health Monitor & Alerting** | EC2, Lambda, Python, CloudWatch | Implementing a Serverless Python function to automatically check server health and fire off alerts. Automation matters. |
| **Database Security Baseline** | RDS, VPC, Security Groups, KMS | Locking down data by enforcing Network Isolation (private subnets) and guaranteeing Data Encryption at Rest. |

## 🧭 The Portfolio Structure: From OS to Cloud

I structured the folders this way because the cloud is built on foundations.  
You can't manage EC2 well if you don't get Linux.  
The numeric prefixes make sure the flow is logical every time you look at the file view.

| **Folder 📁** | **CCP Domain Focus** | **High-Value Skills Demonstrated** |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| `00_Certifications_Study_Guide` | 🥇 Exam Prep | My personal notes and structured resources—shows I take studying seriously. |
| `01_Linux_OS_Foundations` | 💻 Operating Systems | Basic server upkeep: Command Line mastery and file system management. |
| `02_Python_for_DevOps` | 🐍 Scripting & Automation | Core Python used for system admin tasks and making life easier. |
| `03_Database_SQL_Fundamentals` | 🗄️ Database Literacy | I can write proper SQL (CRUD) and know how to talk to databases like RDS. |
| `04_Compute_Services_EC2_Lambda` | 🖥️ Compute | Spinning up EC2s, using Auto Scaling, and deploying Lambda functions. |
| `05_Storage_S3_EBS_EFS` | 💾 Storage | Data durability, managing cost with S3 Lifecycle Policies, Block vs. File Storage tradeoffs. |
| `06_Networking_VPC_Route53` | 🌐 Networking | Building secure, isolated network environments (VPC) from scratch. This stuff is tricky but essential. |
| `07_Security_IAM_KMS_Auditing` | 🔒 Security & Identity | Implementing least-privilege using IAM and auditing user activity with CloudTrail. |
| `08_Automation_CloudFormation_IaC` | ⚙️ Infrastructure as Code | Writing CloudFormation templates (YAML/JSON) so I never have to manually click the console again. |
| `99_Portfolio_Projects` | 🌟 Showcase | The final projects combining multiple services. |

## 📚 Architectural Foundations & Accountability

I prioritize the stuff that really matters when you're managing a budget and compliance.

---

### 1️⃣ Cloud Economics, Billing & Compliance 💰

I'm comfortable talking about the money side of cloud:

- **Cost Management:** I know how to select the right pricing model (Spot, RIs, Savings Plans) to meet both availability and budget goals.  
- **Tools:** I know my way around the TCO Calculator, Cost Explorer, and setting up proactive Cost Budgets.  
- **Shared Responsibility Model:** I understand my part—security IN the cloud—which means I own the configuration, IAM, and data encryption.

---

### 2️⃣ The AWS Well-Architected Framework

Every design decision in this repo is guided by the six pillars.  
It's not just a checklist, it's how you build things the right way:

> **The Six Pillars**
> 1. Operational Excellence  
> 2. Security  
> 3. Reliability  
> 4. Performance Efficiency  
> 5. Cost Optimization  
> 6. Sustainability  

---

## 📌 Next Steps

I'm currently focused on getting the CloudFormation (IaC) folder fully documented and deploying the Highly Available Static Website project.  
I update this every week until the program is done.
